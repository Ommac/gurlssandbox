/**
  * \ingroup Wrappers
  * \brief RecursiveRLSWrapper is the sub-class of GurlsWrapper that implements recursive update
  * of the RLS estimator with retraining capability.
  *
  * Initial parameter selection and training are carried out on a initial set of samples via method train() 
  * which stores all information necessary for efficient recursive update in the options structure.
  * Once the information about initial training is stored, given a new input-output pair, 
  * the RLS estimator can be efficiently updated via the method update().
  * Every time a new input-output pair is available, method update() can be invoked again. Parameter selection and RLS estimation ( method retrain()) can be repeated after any number of online updates.
  * Finally, the eval() method estimates the output for new data.
